# [COVID-19 TimeSeries prediction using Prophet and other chart imports](https://github.com/Aacgectyuoki/COVID19Cases/blob/master/covid-19-project.ipynb)
This project was designed in mid-May 2020, and used to predict future New York City COVID-19 cases. It utilizes Prophet, which is an import that predicts future trends. It is commonly implemented for predicting future stock market prices. The other charts included are the Logarithimic Curve and the Gaussian "Bell" Curve, which also predict the growth and decay of the number of COVID-19 cases.
