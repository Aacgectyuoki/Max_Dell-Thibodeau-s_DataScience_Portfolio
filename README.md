# [COVID-19 TimeSeries prediction using Prophet and other chart imports](https://github.com/Aacgectyuoki/COVID19Cases/blob/master/covid-19-project.ipynb)
This project was designed in mid-May 2020, and used to predict future New York City COVID-19 cases. It utilizes Prophet, which is an import that predicts future trends. It is commonly implemented for predicting future stock market prices. The other charts included are the Logarithimic Curve and the Gaussian "Bell" Curve, which also predict the growth and decay of the number of COVID-19 cases.

If you are curious to know where you would like to live if you plan to move to the "Big Apple," or New York City, I encourage you to take a look at this project. There are plenty of options and plenty of different prices to choose from when moving there.

# [Credit Card Fraud](https://github.com/Aacgectyuoki/CreditCardFraud.py/blob/master/creditcardfraud.ipynb)
This project uses a record of the two days in September 2013 that fraud had happened on European credit cards. When COVID-19 hit New York hard, I had experienced credit card fraud myself, and decided to do a project that would be able to detect it using Machine Learning.
