# COVID-19 TimeSeries prediction using Prophet and the Gaussian "Bell" Curve
This project was designed in mid-May 2020, which was based on predicting how many cases of COVID would occur within the future. It uses an import called Prophet, which can predict future trends. It is commonly implemented for predicting future stock market prices. The other curve is a Gaussian "Bell" Curve, which is the proper curve that the growth and decay of the number of COVID-19 cases there were in New York City.
